    "#Q1. Explain Class and Object with respect to Object-Oriented Programming. Give a suitable example.\n",
    "#Ans: Class: In object-oriented programming, a class is a blueprint or a template for creating objects (an instance of \n",
    "#the class). It defines a set of attributes and behaviors that an object of that class will have. A class can be \n",
    "#considered as a blueprint for the object or objects that can be created using it.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Object: An object is an instance of a class. It is a real-world entity with attributes and behaviors that are defined by \n",
    "#the class. An object has a state and a behavior, and it is created from a class. An object is also known as an instance \n",
    "#of a class.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Example: Let's consider a class called \"Car\". A Car class might have attributes such as color, make, model, and year, \n",
    "#and behaviors such as start, stop, and drive. An object of the Car class would be a specific car, such as a red 2022 \n",
    "#Toyota Corolla. The red 2022 Toyota Corolla would have the attributes of color (red), make (Toyota), model (Corolla), \n",
    "#and year (2022), and it would be able to perform the behaviors start, stop, and drive."

    "#Q2. Name the four pillars of OOPs.\n",
    "#Ans: The four pillars of object-oriented programming (OOP) are:\n",
    "#Abstraction: Abstraction refers to the practice of exposing only the relevant information and hiding the complexity of \n",
    "#the implementation. It allows the user to focus on what the object does rather than how it does it.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Encapsulation: Encapsulation is the mechanism of wrapping the data (variables) and functions that operate on that data \n",
    "#within a single unit or object. This protects the data from accidental corruption and provides a secure way to access \n",
    "#the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Inheritance: Inheritance is a mechanism where a new class can be derived from an existing class. The derived class \n",
    "#inherits all the attributes and behaviors of the parent class and can also have its own attributes and behaviors.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Polymorphism: Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on multiple forms. This is achieved in OOP by defining \n",
    "#methods with the same name in different classes that are related by inheritance. When a method is called on an object, \n",
    "#the correct implementation of that method is executed based on the object's actual class.\n"
